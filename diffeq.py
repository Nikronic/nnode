DiffEq - Base class for differential equations

This module provides the base functionality for all differential equation
objects used in the nnode software.

Example:
    Create an empty DiffEq object.
        diffeq = DiffEq()

Attributes:
    None

Methods:
    None

Todo:
    * Expand base functionality.

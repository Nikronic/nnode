Neural network code for solving ordinary differential equations

This code is my first attempt at implementing the Lagaris et al method for using neural networks to solve differential equations. This first version only handles 1st-order ODEs.

The files ending in '00' are for the simple ODE used during development.

The files ending in '01' are for the first ODE in Lagaris et al (equation (27)).

The files ending in '02' are for the second ODE in Lagaris et al (equation (28)).
